# Airport-Reservation-System-Simulation


<p><strong>Project Overview:</strong> Developed a simulation of an airport reservation system using C++ to manage flight bookings. This project demonstrated advanced proficiency in object-oriented programming, focusing on real-world application of system design principles.</p>

<h3>Technical Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Classes Used:</strong> Implemented three main classes - <em>Reservation</em>, <em>Client</em>, and <em>Flight</em>, to encapsulate the properties and functions necessary for the system.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Flight Booking:</strong> Enabled clients to book flights, ensuring intuitive user interaction and input validation.</li>
    <li><strong>Seat Availability Checks:</strong> Integrated real-time checking of seat availability to prevent overbooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Mile Counter Program:</strong> Developed a loyalty program feature that tracks miles and offers discounts based on travel history.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Display:</strong> Implemented functions to display detailed information about flights and reservations, enhancing user experience and accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Accomplishments:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Successfully simulated an interactive reservation system capable of handling multiple flight schedules and client bookings concurrently.</li>
    <li>Employed robust error handling and data validation techniques to ensure system reliability and usability.</li>
    <li>Enhanced system functionality with a user-friendly interface and detailed reporting features for flight and reservation data.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Object-oriented design, C++ programming, system analysis, problem-solving, user interface design.</p>
